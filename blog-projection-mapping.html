          <p>
            Let’s get something out of the way: projection mapping is not just “projecting images on a wall.”
            That’s called a PowerPoint. This is more like digital origami with light.
          </p>

          <p>
            You take a 3D object—like a building, sculpture, or dessert—and wrap it in motion graphics that fit it
            perfectly. The result? Something that feels a little like special effects… but in real life, and without
            needing a Marvel-sized budget.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you’ve seen a giant cathedral shimmer like stained glass, or a pop concert where the stage folds
            into impossible shapes—chances are, you’ve seen projection mapping in action.
          </p>

          <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

          <p>
            Think of it like tailoring a suit—except the suit is made of moving light, and the mannequin might be a
            wedding cake or a warehouse wall.
          </p>

          <p>Here’s the short version:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Measure or scan the object you’re mapping onto.</li>
            <li>Design visuals that match the object's shape, edges, and angles.</li>
            <li>Warp and align the visuals using software so they land exactly where they’re supposed to.</li>
            <li>
              Project it all using a high-lumen projector
              (translation: it needs to be bright enough to outshine your uncle’s iPhone flashlight).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It’s part technical wizardry, part digital puppetry, and part trial-and-error with snacks. The projector
            becomes a brush, the surface becomes the canvas, and the illusion becomes… kind of magical.
          </p>

          <h2>What Can You Do With It?</h2>

          <p>Good question. That’s where things get interesting.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Weddings:</strong> Imagine a cake that glows, sparkles, or tells your love story in animated scenes.
              It’s less messy than fireworks and a lot harder to forget.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Events & Installations:</strong> Map an entire building for a block party. Animate a sculpture in
              a gallery. Turn a boring product booth into something people actually want to photograph.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Theater & Performance:</strong> Set changes without lifting a finger. Environments that shift in
              real time with the emotion of a scene.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retail & Interior Design:</strong> Mood lighting that’s dynamic. Product displays that literally
              come to life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Home DIY:</strong> Rare, but technically possible. If you’ve got a projector and a wall, you could
              be mapping right now.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why I’m Picky About Projects</h2>

          <p>
            There’s no “template” for projection mapping. Every project is built from the ground up. So when I take
            something on, I want it to be worth the time, energy, and loss of sleep.
          </p>

          <p>I’m especially interested in:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Weddings with character (especially those where the cake is the star for five glorious minutes)</li>
            <li>Events that want a true “wow” moment—not just a slideshow</li>
            <li>Small-scale experimental installations where art meets tech meets curiosity</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you’re just looking for a rented projector and someone to press play—that’s not me.
            But if you’re dreaming up something unusual, immersive, or just a little weird (in a good way),
            I’d love to hear about it.
          </p>

          <h2>A Quick Detour Into Inspiration</h2>

          <p>
            What inspires me? People. Stories. Everyday moments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve always been fascinated by the idea that everyone has a story. Even the person you sit next to on a
            train for five minutes—they’ve got decades of backstory, heartbreaks, victories, routines, and dreams
            you’ll never know about.
          </p>

          <p>
            That invisible richness—that’s what I try to tap into, whether I’m building a visual moment or capturing
            a quiet scene on camera.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t create to explain things. I create to slow them down—so we can actually notice them.
          </p>

          <h2>Want to Try Projection Mapping?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>It’s more accessible than you think.</li>
            <li>For larger projects, you’ll want someone who knows what they’re doing (hi 👋).</li>
            <li>Most people don’t know it’s even an option. That’s why I do it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you’re planning something and want it to stand out, consider projection mapping.
            It doesn’t just decorate a space—it transforms it.
          </p>

          <h2>Let’s Talk</h2>

          <p>
            If you're curious, reach out. I might not take every project—but if it’s got the right mix of creative
            spark, storytelling potential, and technical challenge, I’m all in.
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you’re wondering what kind of projector I recommend, or whether your venue is even possible to map,
            I’m happy to chat. No hard sell. Just real answers.
          </p>

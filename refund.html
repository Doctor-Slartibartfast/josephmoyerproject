      <p>
        Thanks for supporting <strong>The Joseph Moyer Project</strong>. Each product is made just for you when you place your order—whether
        it’s a photo print, design piece, or something wonderfully weird from the creative side of my brain.
      </p>

      <h2>All Sales Are Final</h2>
      <p>
        Because items are printed and fulfilled on demand via print-on-demand partners such as Printful, I cannot accept returns, exchanges,
        or refunds for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buyer’s remorse</li>
        <li>Incorrect sizing or color choice</li>
        <li>Slight color differences between screen and print</li>
        <li>Items delivered to the wrong address due to customer error</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please double-check your order details before submitting. If you’re unsure about anything, email me first—I’m happy to help.
      </p>

      <h2>Damaged, Misprinted, or Defective Items</h2>
      <p>
        If your item arrives misprinted, damaged, or clearly defective, please email
        <strong> thejosephmoyerproject@gmail.com</strong> within 30 days of receiving the product.
      </p>
      <p>Include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your order number</li>
        <li>A clear photo of the issue</li>
        <li>A short description of what went wrong</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once verified, I’ll work with the production partner to provide a free replacement or a refund.
      </p>

      <h2>Lost or Stolen Packages</h2>
      <p>
        Once an order is handed off to the shipping carrier, it’s literally out of my hands. If your package is marked as delivered but
        nowhere to be found:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check with neighbors, roommates, or building management</li>
        <li>Wait a day or two—it may still arrive</li>
        <li>Contact your local carrier with the tracking information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you’re still stuck, email me and I’ll see what can be done. I can’t promise refunds for lost or stolen items, but I’ll always
        do my best to help.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>
      <p>
        Need to report a problem, ask a question, or send a photo of your order in its new natural habitat?<br />
        📧 <strong>thejosephmoyerproject@gmail.com</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I want you to be happy with your experience—and if something’s gone sideways, I want to help make it right.

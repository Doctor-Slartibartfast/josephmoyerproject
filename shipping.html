      <h2>Fulfillment & Shipping Process</h2>
      <p>
        Most items in The Joseph Moyer Project store—especially prints, posters, and apparel—are fulfilled through a trusted
        third-party production partner such as <strong>Printful</strong>. Each product is made specially for you as soon as you
        place an order. That takes a little extra time, but it helps reduce overproduction and waste.
      </p>
      <p>Estimated fulfillment time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically 2–7 business days depending on the item</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Estimated shipping times (after fulfillment):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>USA: 3–5 business days</li>
        <li>Canada: 5–10 business days</li>
        <li>Europe: 5–10 business days</li>
        <li>International: 10–20 business days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are estimates, not guarantees. Once an order leaves the production facility, it's in the hands of the shipping carrier.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
      <p>
        Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on your location, order size, and shipping method. The goal is to keep things
        fair and reasonable while still making sure your artwork arrives safely.
      </p>

      <h2>Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        You’ll receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number once your order is on its way. If your package seems lost
        or confused about its destination, feel free to reach out for help.
      </p>

      <h2>Multiple Shipments</h2>
      <p>
        If you order multiple items, they may ship separately depending on what you purchased and where it’s being produced. That’s normal.
      </p>

      <h2>Customs & Import Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        International orders may be subject to customs fees or import taxes depending on your country’s policies. These fees are the
        responsibility of the buyer.
      </p>

      <h2>Damaged or Lost Items</h2>
      <p>
        If your item arrives damaged or appears to be lost in transit, please contact
        <strong> thejosephmoyerproject@gmail.com</strong> within 14 days of delivery. Include your order number, photos (if applicable),
        and a brief description of the issue. I’ll work with the production partner to get you a replacement as quickly as possible.

      <p>
        At <strong>The Joseph Moyer Project</strong>, everyone is welcome. Whether you’re here to explore photography, soak in some writing,
        request projection mapping, or grab a print for your wall (or spaceship), this website is intended to be as inclusive and accessible
        as possible—because creativity should never have a gatekeeper.
      </p>

      <h2>Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        The site is built with modern web standards and hosted on <strong>Netlify</strong>. Efforts are ongoing to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use clear fonts and strong color contrast</li>
        <li>Provide descriptive alt text for meaningful images</li>
        <li>Use semantic HTML and logical heading structure</li>
        <li>Keep navigation keyboard-friendly</li>
        <li>Avoid flashing or rapidly strobing content</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ongoing Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility is an ongoing process, not a checkbox. If you encounter a barrier—whether a button is hard to reach with a keyboard,
        text is difficult to read, or any feature is giving your assistive tech a hard time—I’d genuinely like to know.
      </p>
